Acceptance: minimal auth to protect APIs (no cloud dependency).

Epic 1.3 — Frontend basic app

Electron + React app skeleton.

Task list UI (create/view/edit/delete).

Acceptance: tasks show in UI and persist.

Epic 1.4 — Local storage & sync opt-in

Implement local backup & export (JSON).

Acceptance: user exports/imports data successfully.

Design opt-in cloud backup flow (placeholder).

Acceptance: UI/UX mock present (no cloud calls).

QA / Acceptance for Phase 1:

End-to-end test: create task in UI → saved encrypted in DB → app shows it after restart.

Phase 2 — Voice & AI Planning (LLM + STT/TTS)

Goal: allow voice/text planning; AI suggest daily plans.

Epic 2.1 — STT integration

Integrate Parakeet STT (or equivalent) into app.

Acceptance: voice → text works locally; sample command recognized.

Create voice command parser & intent mapping.

Acceptance: commands like “add meeting at 5 PM” create correct task.

Epic 2.2 — TTS integration

Integrate Coqui TTS and voice tone presets (calm, cheerful, focused).

Acceptance: system can read notifications and reflection prompts in chosen tone.

Epic 2.3 — LLM planning assistant

Integrate chosen local LLM (7B) or cloud fallback.

Acceptance: LLM returns suggested daily plan given task list + mood input.

Implement AI planner API (input: tasks + constraints + mood → output: plan + priorities).

Acceptance: generated plan matches constraints in tests.

Epic 2.4 — Voice UX flows

“Quick add” via voice flow (confirmation & undo).

Acceptance: voice add → user confirmation → task saved.

“What’s my plan for today?” readout flow.

Acceptance: app reads plan via TTS.

QA / Acceptance for Phase 2:

Voice latency measured; acceptable for local setup. (Record measured values for CI.)

Phase 3 — Mood Integration & Smart Prioritization

Goal: combine Mind side mood scores with tasks for adaptive prioritization.

Epic 3.1 — Mood API & data contracts

Define API for Mind → Work data (daily mood score, metadata).

Acceptance: API contract document + mock data.

Implement import adapter to read mood entries.

Acceptance: mood entries appear in local DB.

Epic 3.2 — Mood-task correlation engine

Implement simple correlation algorithm (productivity score formula + mood multiplier).

Acceptance: computed productivity score stored per day.

Epic 3.3 — Smart prioritization logic

Add “Focus Score” generation for tasks (0–100) using urgency, deadline, energy, mood.

Acceptance: sample tasks reorder correctly in unit tests.

UI: show recommended order and explain rationale (short sentence).

Acceptance: UI shows explanation beneath prioritized list.

Epic 3.4 — Adaptive notifications

Mood-based tone & notification scheduling (e.g., soft reminders when stressed).

Acceptance: notification change observed when mood low.

QA / Acceptance for Phase 3:

Simulated mood changes reflect on suggestions & notifications.

Phase 4 — Productivity Tracking & Insights Dashboard

Goal: visualize trends, enable reflection, and export insights.

Epic 4.1 — Telemetry & logging (local)

Implement task completion logging (timestamps, durations, self-rated focus).

Acceptance: logs exist for each completed task.

Epic 4.2 — Analytics engine

Implement daily/week aggregates: tasks planned/completed, focus time, productivity score.

Acceptance: aggregated endpoints return expected results.

Epic 4.3 — Dashboard UI

Charts: Mood vs Productivity, Weekly trend, Streaks, Word cloud for journal.

Acceptance: charts render and update with sample data.

Export daily summary (PDF/JSON).

Acceptance: export file downloads and contains correct summary.

Epic 4.4 — Reflection workflows

End-of-day voice prompt & journal entry flow + STT for dictated reflections.

Acceptance: reflection saved and appears in dashboard.

QA / Acceptance for Phase 4:

Dashboard shows correct numbers after a week of simulated activity.

Phase 5 — Motivation Engine & Adaptive Suggestions

Goal: fine-tune empathy & personalised nudges.

Epic 5.1 — Tone adaptation rules

Map mood ranges to TTS tone/phrasing templates.

Acceptance: given mood X, chosen tone is used.

Epic 5.2 — Motivational dialogue generator

Templates + LLM-generated short dialogues tailored to user context.

Acceptance: sample dialogues pass content QA (no harmful suggestions).

Epic 5.3 — Routine recommender (basic)

LLM suggests simple routines from recent trends (e.g., “Try 90-minute deep work then 20-minute break”).

Acceptance: generated routine references user’s own data.

Epic 5.4 — Safety & guardrails

Avoid overreach (no clinical advice); include fallback suggestions to seek help if persistent low mood.

Acceptance: safety checklist and tests.

QA / Acceptance for Phase 5:

Human review of motivational messages for tone & appropriateness.

Phase 6 — Testing, Beta & Refinement

Goal: polish UX, fix bugs, measure targets with real users.

Epic 6.1 — Unit, integration & E2E tests

Coverage targets per module.

Acceptance: tests run in CI; critical paths covered.

Epic 6.2 — Internal alpha testing

Small internal group uses app; collect feedback.

Acceptance: bug tracker items created and triaged.

Epic 6.3 — Closed beta (external)

Recruit beta users; run 2–4 week pilot, collect NPS & qualitative feedback.

Acceptance: beta report with metrics and feature requests.

Epic 6.4 — Performance & scaling

Measure voice response latency, LLM inference times; optimize quantization/caching.

Acceptance: documented performance baseline and optimization tasks.

Epic 6.5 — Accessibility & localization

Basic accessibility checks (keyboard nav, screen reader labels); prepare for locale support.

Acceptance: accessibility audit report.

QA / Acceptance for Phase 6:

Beta satisfaction ≥ target threshold (your chosen KPI) or iterate.

Acceptance: v2 commitments + backlog.

Cross-cutting tasks (ongoing)

These should be in the backlog and scheduled continuously.

Documentation: user guide, dev docs, API spec.

Security reviews & penetration checks.
